Many modules are hidden in this stack. Use "module --show_hidden spider SOFTWARE" if you are not able to find the required software

Lmod is automatically replacing "gcc/12.2.0" with
"intel-oneapi-compilers/2023.2.0".


Inactive Modules:
  1) cuda/12.1.1       3) openblas/0.3.24     5) python_cuda/3.11.6
  2) nccl/2.18.3-1     4) python/3.11.6

/cluster/project/cvl/guosun/shangye/Vim/lib/python3.10/site-packages/torch/distributed/launch.py:181: FutureWarning: The module torch.distributed.launch is deprecated
and will be removed in future. Use torchrun.
Note that --use-env is set by default in torchrun.
If your script expects `--local-rank` argument to be set, please
change it to read from `os.environ['LOCAL_RANK']` instead. See

[W reducer.cpp:1346] Warning: find_unused_parameters=True was specified in DDP constructor, but did not find any unused parameters in the forward pass. This flag results in an extra traversal of the autograd graph every iteration,  which can adversely affect performance. If your model indeed never has any unused parameters in the forward pass, consider turning this flag off. Note that this warning may be a false positive if your model has flow control causing later iterations to have unused parameters. (function operator())
